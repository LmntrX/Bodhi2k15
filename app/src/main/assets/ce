												Trestle: Bridge it<br>
												Bridges are one of the most useful and magnificent
												structures of the modern civilization. With ever
												improving designs bridges carry immense loads daily
												and are also expected to handle incidental loads
												due to natural calamities. We bring you a bridge
												making competition that would test your ability to
												design and construct the most efficient bridge
												within the specifications. Model bridges are
												intended to be simplified versions of real world
												bridges, which are designed to accept.
											</p>
											<p></p>
											<p id="rules">
												Rules
											</p>1) Form a group of two; all two participants must
											be from the same educational institution.<br>
											2) The participants must carry valid identity card of
											the institution to which they belong to; failing which
											they will not be allowed to take part in the event.<br>
											3) The bridge must be constructed only from Popsicle
											sticks and Fevicol white adhesives.<br>
											4) Sticks may be cut or trimmed to any shape or
											size.<br>
											5) Bridge failure is defined as the inability of the
											bridge to carry additional load.<br>
											Design Criteria<br>
											1) The choice of the type of bridge is upon the
											discretion of participant.<br>
											2) The bridge shall be of single deck, though which a
											vehicle of width 100mm and height 100mm can move.<br>
											3) Clear span between the supports shall be 600mm and
											width 120mm.<br>
											4) The deck shall be continuous and height of the
											bottom of deck shall be 150mm from the ground
											level.<br>
											Testing Procedure<br>
											1) A vehicle of dimension 100mm x 100mm x 100mm and
											weights 50kg will pass through the deck.<br>
											2) The bridge will be loaded at mid span and deflection
											shall be recorded.<br>
											3) The bridge obtaining highest Load Bearing
											Capacity(LBC) shall be selected to the first
											position.<br>
											4) Load bearing capacity will be calculated as
											follows:<br>
											LBC = [Load taken for failure (kg)] / [Deflection at
											Mid Point(mm) x Self weight of the bridge(kg)]<br>
											5) Result will be based on the perfection in crafting
											(25%contribution) and LBC(75% contribution).
